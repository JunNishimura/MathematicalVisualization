## What I learned from this practice

1. Simple is the best.

Simple is the best. Especially when things get complicated, I was trying to add more logics to solve problems. But I need to look for the ways to solve problems with less codes and logics. "Simple is the best", which is the word I have to keep in mind all the time.

2. Clarification

When I face some problems, I'm Googling to solve them. But before googling, it is better to clarify things below.
(1) What is the problem anyway?
(2) What is the ideal goal of solving the problem?
(3) What do you understand right now?
(4) What things you need to know (need to googling) to achieve (2)? 
Without clarifying things which you want to understand, it takes more time to solve problems than necessity. As I was googling deeper, things which I wanted to know was much blurred. So I just need to clarify things above before googling.
